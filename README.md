My laptop went in a problem (causing it to shut down and not turning on)causing the codes for final assessment first game to not run for the video and my mac restarts every time I run the code shuting anaconda navigator till I restart it again as it kep resulting in my computer turning off. Please do look into the code but there is no video for it as it took me about a week plus to code it out only for my computer to give up on me last minute. It will be even better if that code can be used for grading and interview too! Thank you for your understanding
